# QST Badger Hams:
From **0000Z 9 Feb 2026 to 1159Z 13 Feb 2026**, the ARRL School Club Roundup is in full swing.
SCR is the biggest contest of our semester, and a great way to get exposure to amateur radio! Swing by the Shack (check our Discord for occupied times) throughout the week to see some contesting in action - and do some, if you're so inclined!

Our regular weekly meetings will continue 4PM CST on Tuesdays, but during the duration of roundup, our focus will be on contest operating. Hope to see you there!

Have a great week, and take care!
