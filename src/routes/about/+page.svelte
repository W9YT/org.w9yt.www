		About the Badger Amateur Radio Society
	</h2>
	
	<p class="py-4">
		The Badger Amateur Radio Society - W9YT - is the amateur radio club at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  
		The FCC-issued callsign, W9YT, now held by the Badger Amateur Radio Society (aka BARS) has been in use at the 
		University of Wisconsin-Madison since 1930.
	</p>
	<p class="py-4">
		Our space, colloquially know as "The Shack", is in the penthouse on top of the Engineering Research Building. 
		This puts the antennas up about 240 feet. From the shack we have HF, VHF and UHF capabilities for terrestrial 
		and satellite operation.
	</p>
	<p class="py-4">
		The shack also has test equipment for use by club members, such as signal generators, spectrum analyzers and 
		oscilloscopes.  Common workbench tools are also available.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also operate several repeaters for the local Madison area, more on our <a href="/repeaters/" class="underline">repeaters page</a>.
