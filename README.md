# w9yt.org source
Source code for the Badger Amateur Radio Society's self-hosted website and portal for various resources available to students, faculty, and community members. The Badger Amateur Radio Society (W9YT) is a registered student organization at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, furthering the art of amateur radio for any and all interested parties.

# Purpose
W9YT BARS is a historic amateur radio club located on the University of Wisconsin - Madison campus, under the College of Engineering's 
Department of Electrical Engineering. The purposes of the club are to promote local amateur radio activity within the club and within the area,
to provide the opportunity to learn about and interact with amateur radio as a hobby, to provide club members the opportunity to practice good
operating skills and test equipment, and to provide a recreational connection to scientific concepts UW-Madison students and faculty interact
with on a regular basis. 

The club website - w9yt.org - acts as a central location for club resources, announcements, communications, and any other information 
pertinent to the day-to-day functioning of the club. The aim of this development is to create an accessible, appealing, and professional
website to represent the club to any and all interested parties around the world.

BARS participates in a number of projects, ranging from on-campus radio demonstrations and installations, to internationally-recognized 
archival activities (specifically concerning our QSL card collection). We hope this website acts as a conduit for what the club has to offer.
